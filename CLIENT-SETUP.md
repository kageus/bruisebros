## Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to server"

- Are you on the same WiFi network?
- Did you type the server address correctly?

**Try:**
- Close Minecraft and relaunch
- Restart your computer
- Ask parent to check server logs

### "Mod rejection" error

This means your mods don't match the server.

**Fix:**
- Make sure you installed the modpack (not vanilla Minecraft)
- Check for updates (right-click instance → Update)
- Ask parent if server was recently updated

### Prism Launcher won't start

**Try:**
- Restart your computer
- Run as administrator (right-click → Run as administrator)
- Reinstall Prism Launcher

### Game crashes

**Check:**
- Do you have enough RAM? (Need at least 8GB total on computer)
- Is Java up to date?
- Try allocating less memory (2GB instead of 4GB)

**Report to parent:**
- When it crashes (loading world? playing game?)
- Any error messages

## Tips for Kids

### Multiple Instances

You can have multiple versions of Minecraft:
- Vanilla Minecraft (no mods)
- Family server modpack
- Other modpacks for single-player

Each instance is separate. Just launch the one you want to play!

### Organizing Instances

- **Rename instances:** Right-click → Rename
- **Add instance icon:** Right-click → Edit → Change icon
- Makes it easier to find the right one!

### Performance Tips

If game is laggy:
- Lower render distance in Options → Video Settings
- Turn off fancy graphics
- Close other programs (web browser, etc.)

## Migrating from MultiMC (Optional)

If you were using MultiMC before:

1. In **MultiMC:** Select instance → Export Instance → Save .zip
2. In **Prism Launcher:** Add Instance → Import → Choose .zip file
3. Wait for import
4. Delete old MultiMC instance
5. Done! Same instance, new launcher
